# CNN
These notebooks will cover Convolutional Neural Network design from basic to advanced using TensorFlow.
Topics that are covered in each notebook are as follows - 
1. Basic CNN architecture design -- Dropout Regularization -- Batch Normalization
2. CNN with Callbacks
3. Using Pre-trained CNN architecture for prediction
4. Working on real-world datasets -- Data augmentation
5. Transfer Learning 
6. U-Net
