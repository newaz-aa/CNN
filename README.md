# CNN
These notebooks will cover Convolutional Neural Network design from basic to advanced using TensorFlow.
Topics that are covered in each notebook are as follows - 
01. Basic CNN architecture design -- Dropout Regularization -- Batch Normalization 
02. CNN with Callbacks
2. Working on real-world datasets
3. Using established architectures like VGG16
4. Transfer Learning 
5. U-Net
